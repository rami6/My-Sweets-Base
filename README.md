## Introduction
Sweets makers keep a lot of information in a variety of places. 
Recipes, ingredients which we have, the best way of arrangement, etc… 
We need to refer those information when we plan sweets to make next, but some information is always missing from our mind.

## Ingredients of this app
- Vue.js
- Django
- Django REST Framework(library)
- SQLite
  
For deploy, I use following technologies:
- Heroku - server
- PostgreSQL - database(replacement of SQLite)
- AWS S3 - storage for pictures which users upload
  
Now I'm working on deploying in a private brunch. The branch contains sensitive data, so I will never push to GitHub.  
However, features in this repogitory are keeping up to date because I will try locally and update this master branch first.
